# `create-empty-caption-file`

This is a Rust program that creates caption files for images in a specified directory. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Imports**: The program first imports the `File` struct from the `std::fs` module and the `WalkDir` struct from the `walkdir` crate.

2. **Function `create_caption_file(directory: &str)`:** This function takes a directory path as an argument and walks through all the files in the directory and its subdirectories.

    - For each file, it checks if the file extension is "jpg", "jpeg", or "png". If it is, it means the file is an image file.
    - It then creates a new file path by replacing the image file's extension with "txt". This new file path points to what will be the caption file for the image.
    - If the caption file doesn't already exist, it creates a new empty file at that path.

3. **Function `main()`:** This is the entry point of the program. It specifies the directory path and calls the `create_caption_file` function with this path. After the function call, it prints a success message to the console.

In summary, this program creates empty caption files (with .txt extension) corresponding to each image file (with .jpg, .jpeg, .png extensions) in a specified directory and its subdirectories. The caption files can later be filled with descriptions or annotations for the images. If a caption file already exists for an image, the program leaves it as is. The directory to be processed is hard-coded as "E:\\training_dir_staging" in the `main` function.
